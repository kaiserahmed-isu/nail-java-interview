         * Polymorphism is the ability for an object or function to take many forms. There are two main types of polymorphism in Java: Runtime polymorphism and compile time polymorphism. We can perform these in Java with method overriding and method overloading.
         *
         * Let's take a look at an example of runtime polymorphism with method overriding first. In this code, we have a base 'Animal' class that has a base implementation of the the method 'sound'. Since we don't know what type of animal it is, we have to keep this implementation very generic. However, let's say we had a class called 'Pig'. Since 'Pig' is an animal, we can extend the 'Animal' class, and so we can write 'extends Animal'.
         *
         * Compile Time Polymorphism. We can achieve compile time polymorphism by adding method overloading to our program. Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different. Again, this is similar to before where one method or function has many different forms.
