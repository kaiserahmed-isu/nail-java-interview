         * . Inheritance is the process where one class acquires the fields and methods of another. With inheritance, we can write the common properties and functionality in one class, and have other classes with unique features all extend this single class, making code more re-usable. Instead of writing the same common implementation multiple times, we can write it once, and then have whatever class needs this functionality extend this class.
         *
         *  One of the main advantages to inheritance is minimizing the amount of duplicate code. It also allows for data hiding, where the base class can keep some data private, and this can not be accessed by the subclass.
         *
         *  The main disadvantage of inheritance is that the super class and the subclass can become tightly coupled, meaning they cannot be used independently of each other.
