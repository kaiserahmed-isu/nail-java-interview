        /**
         *  Encapsulation means binding an object's state and behaviors in Java, fields, and methods, together. It's a way of wrapping data and code acting on the data into a single unit. In Java, this is a class.
         *
         *  The reason we might do this is because we want to keep classes separated and prevent them from being tightly coupled with each other. With encapsulation, the variables and data of a given class is hidden from any other class and can only be accessed through specific methods of its own class. This is also known as data hiding.
         *
         *  In Java, we can achieve encapsulation by declaring all the fields in a class private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of these variables.
         *
         *
         *   We use encapsulation so that the user has no idea of the inner implementation of a given class and the data it contains. The user only knows how to pass values to a getter method, but does not need to know how these values are stored within the program. This could help keep classes separated as we've noted before.
         *
         *   Encapsulation is different from abstraction because abstraction provides generalization. While encapsulation hides unwanted implementation details from the actual users of an object.
         *   We write encapsulated code because it improves the re-usability of our program and makes it easy to change when new requirements come along.
         *   Furthermore, encapsulation makes unit testing much easier.
